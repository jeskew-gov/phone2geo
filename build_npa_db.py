# This script will process two reports published by NANPA (the North American
# Numbering Plan Administrator) and one published the National Pooling
# Administrator. All reports were freely downloadable by the public as of 28
# February 2020.
#
# The first, the NPA Database, contains the complete listing of NPA (area code)
# assignments of all countries within the North American Numbering Plan as well
# as the geography and intended usage associated with a given NPA. It can be
# downloaded from https://www.nationalnanpa.com/nanp1/npa_report.csv
#
# The second, Central Office Code Assignment Records, contains a listing of
# NPA-NXX (area code + three digit exchange prefix) allocations and the
# rate center and carrier with which an exchange is associated. In the case of a
# pooled exchange, the rate center and carrier may not be accurate for all
# numbers within the exchange. It can be downloaded from
# https://www.nationalnanpa.com/nanp1/allutlzd.zip
#
# The third report, Block Report by Region, details the assignment of individual
# thousands blocks within pooled exchanges. It can be downloaded from
# https://www.nationalpooling.com/reports/region/AllBlocksAugmentedReport.zip
